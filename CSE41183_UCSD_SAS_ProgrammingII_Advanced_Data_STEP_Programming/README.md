# CSE41183_UCSD_SAS_ProgrammingII_Advanced_Data_STEP_Programming
The course provides an in-depth theoretical aspect of how SAS DATA step processes during the DATA step compilation and execution phases. Course topics include understanding how the program data vector (PDV) works, BY-group processing, writing loops in the DATA step and array processing. In addition, data cleaning techniques, various ways of combining data sets and some useful data management SAS procedures are also introduced. Many programming work-related examples will be demonstrated and students will also have opportunities to practice solving real-life problems via exercises and assignments.
