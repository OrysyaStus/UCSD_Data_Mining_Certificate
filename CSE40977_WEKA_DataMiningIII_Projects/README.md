# CSE40977_UCSD_WEKA_DataMiningIII_Projects
Data Mining III combines and builds upon Data Mining I, Data Prep for Data Mining, and Data Mining II. This class is designed to give students in-depth knowledge of practical data mining and predictive modeling, provided they have acquired the necessary theoretical knowledge of data mining and machine learning techniques, as well as data preparation techniques. Students will go through several data mining projects, planning and executing the data preparation steps of analysis, learning and modeling, and identifying the predictive/descriptive model that produces the best evaluation scores at the end. This challenging class will ensure preparedness for complex real-life data mining tasks.
