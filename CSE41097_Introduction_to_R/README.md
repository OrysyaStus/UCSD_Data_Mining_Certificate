Statistical computing is employed within a diverse range of industries. In recent years, an open source project, R, has emerged as the preeminent statistical computing platform. With its unsurpassed library of freely available packages, R is capable of addressing almost every statistical inference problem. In this course, you will learn to create R programs that access data from multiple sources, including flat files, spreadsheets, and relational databases. Also covered is the complete foundational skill set for R programming, including matrix operations, conditional and repetitive execution, functions, and graphical output.
