# CSE40933_UCSD_Introduction_to_SQL_Programming_Concepts
Learn how to use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, manipulate, and create reports from database tables. Important concepts associated with relational databases will be covered. You will run SQL commands to create database tables and define data element types. Single and multiple table queries will be created with simple and compound conditions using SQL operators such as: BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, EXIST, ALL, and ANY. Basic and complex reports will be created based on data in a table or view. Database Administration features of SQL will be discussed.
